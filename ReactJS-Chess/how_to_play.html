            <p class="paragraph">Hello, challenger! Welcome to this majestic realm. You are the white player,
            and your opponent is the black player (a rather unsociable bot). To play, click on the piece you want to move,
            and then click on the desired destination.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">ReactJS Chess makes chess easy for novice players; when you select a piece, the game
            highlights valid destinations. You can also view previous moves by clicking on the arrow buttons, and you
            can even reset the game. But keep in mind that only a weakling would retreat!</p>

          <h1 class="header">Rules of Chess</h1>
          <p class="paragraph">Don't be a barbarianâ€”learn the rules of chess! Visit
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_of_chess" target="_blank">this link</a>
          to do just that. ReactJS Chess implements all of these rules, except for draws (other than stalemate),
          resigning, and time limits.</p>
